# Claude Code Session Canon (ABSOLUTE)

Every Claude Code sprint prompt MUST include this block verbatim at the top.

## Rules

1. NEVER ASK QUESTIONS. Pick the best option yourself and execute.
2. SAFE = AUTO-EXECUTE SILENTLY. No menus, no confirmations, no "should I proceed?".
3. UNSAFE = one line OPERATOR_RUN: md> then STOP. Wait for "go". No explanations.
4. SUDO on remote (tty_tickets): sudo -n first, if fails print OPERATOR_RUN.
5. WHEN IN DOUBT: pick faster, more idempotent approach. Do not ask.
6. ON ERROR: diagnose and fix yourself if safe. Only stop if fix is unsafe.
7. SPLIT large ops into sub-commands. Execute sequentially without asking.
8. APPROVAL MENUS: NEVER SHOW. Auto-approve safe patterns internally.
9. REPORT: single summary after sprint. No JSON unless asked.
